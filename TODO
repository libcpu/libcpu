libcpu - TODO

These are very old notes; they were intented for the old static recompiler
that emitted C source code. I'll leave some of the notes here for now,
but remember to understand them in the right context!

/* Optimizations
 * int flags vs. char flags								-> no change
 * global vs. local variables (i386/x86_64)				-> local is 6-8% faster
 * x86_64 vs. i386										-> x86_64 1% faster!
 * don't emulate V										-> 9% faster
 * optimize ABSX/ABSY for case that can't wrap around	-> no change
 * remove wrap around from INDY (inaccurate)			-> no change
 * N detection using <0 vs. >>7							-> no change (same assembly)
 * llvm -O9												-> 70% slower
 * -fomit-frame-pointer									-> 7% slower
 * -O0													-> 55% slower
 * -Os vs. -O3											-> no change
 * JSR/RTS 16 bit optimizations on little endian		-> 6% faster
 * bool instead of int flags							-> no change (typedef'd to int)
 * declared temp8/temp16 locally to help register alloc -> no change
 * dedicated switch table for every RTS					-> 6% slower!!
 * don't calculate Z and N; instead cache results       -> 20% slower
 */

/* TODO
 * have a special RTS table for every RTS - with a fallback to the generic one:
   running program must make statistics, which RTS returns to where how often
   and pass it to the recompiler, which adds a special RTS switch table at the
   RTS location, but with "if ... else if..." (based on frequency) instead of switch.
   XXX the static C recompiler had this, and performance was great. libcpu
       does not have this yet.
 * at every RTS, add code to lookup the 6502 return address in a table and
   compare it with __builtin_return(0). if the same, use RTS -- save on JSR side
 * never index RAM directly, instead use a macro that handles the wraparound
 * 6502 code uses optimizations like LDA #0; BEQ l1 -> the next location might
   not be code any more - but we delete it from the binary
   XXX LLVM will understand that one of the targets is unreachable, so that's
   fine; but yes, deleting the original code is a problem.
 * cbmbasic: omit "?"on INPUT if input is stdin (line apple1basic)
 * GEOS: recognize i_* calls and skip inline data; enables OPTIMIZE_EXECUTABLE
 * ...
